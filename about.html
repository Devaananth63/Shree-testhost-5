                <h1>Founder's Note</h1>
                <p>
                    When I started Shree Gokul Shipping Services, I didn’t just see containers or cargo I saw stories. Behind every shipment was someone’s trust, someone’s dream. That sense of responsibility shaped the way we worked then, and still guides us today.

                    This company was built with the belief that logistics isn’t just about moving goods it’s about delivering promises. From humble beginnings in Tuticorin to handling complex freight across regions, our journey has been one of passion, perseverance, and people.

                    I’m proud of the team we’ve built and the relationships we’ve nurtured. To our clients, thank you for trusting us. To our future partners, we look forward to earning your trust the same way with dedication, honesty, and unmatched service.
